# Disease-Prediciton
- It is a flask and Machine learning project. The concept is predicting the disease on the basis of disease choosed by the patient. As it 
a predicting the class of given input and classifying it based on some features and attributes (probabilistic classification algorithm), 
Gaussian Naive Bayes model is used.

# Front-end
- Front-end is made using HTML and CSS. HTML files are saved in templates directory and CSS file is name as style.css and saved in static file.
- There are two web pages, Index.html(for the main page) and result.html(another page for displaying the output/result).

# Back-end
- Flask is used for backend.
- app.py is the main file where all the functions are declared and defined. 

# Model
- Gaussian NB  is used as it is a probabilistic classification algorithm.
- The data is already splited for training and testing and saved as Training.csv and Testing.csv respectively.
- The model is saved in model.py
- Model is used in app.py with the help of pickle module.

# What can be improved?
- The front-end design.
- dropdown or dropdown with search bar can be added while submitting symptoms.


Any other improvement, changes, errors, bug reporting/suggestions are heartly welcome. Do share your suggestions.
